## Current Objectives

- Test the updated `requirements.txt` to ensure the project works as expected with the new dependencies.
- Address errors encountered during testing.

## Context

- The user has updated the `requirements.txt` file.
- We need to verify that the project is still functional after this update.
- Related to the "Update dependencies according to `requirements.txt`" task in `projectRoadmap.md`.
- Running the test suite resulted in errors related to missing modules (`nilmtk`, `torch`).
- The `nilmtk` package is not directly compatible with Python 3.12 and is not available in the current virtual environment.
- The `nilmtk` repository has been forked, cloned, and moved to the user's home directory (`/home/punshs/nilmtk`) to update its compatibility.

## Next Steps

- Update dependencies and code in the forked `nilmtk` repository to ensure compatibility with Python 3.12 and other project requirements.
- Test the changes made to the forked `nilmtk` repository.
- Install `nilmtk` from the new location (`/home/punshs/nilmtk`) in editable mode within the `deep_nilmtk` project's virtual environment.
- Run the `deep_nilmtk` project's test suite again to verify that the import errors are resolved.
- Address any remaining errors or failures that arise during testing.

## Instructions for the user

1. Activate the "nilm" Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate nilm
   ```
2. Navigate to the project's root directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/punshs/Dropbox/Software_Development/deep-nilmtk-v1
   ```
3. Install `nilmtk` from its new location in editable mode:
    ```bash
    pip install -e /home/punshs/nilmtk
    ```
4. Run the tests using `pytest`:
   ```bash
   pytest
