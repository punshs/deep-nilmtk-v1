## Project Goals

- Get the project working with the updated dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- Ensure all tests pass after the update.
- Refactor or update code as needed to maintain compatibility with the new dependencies.

## Key Features

- NILM model training and disaggregation using PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- Data loading and preprocessing for various datasets.
- Hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation.

## Completion Criteria

- All tests pass successfully.
- The project can be used for training and disaggregation with the updated dependencies.
- Any necessary code changes are implemented and documented.

## Progress Tracker

- [x] Update dependencies according to `requirements.txt`.
- [ ] Run tests and address any failures.
- [ ] Refactor code if needed.

## Completed Tasks
